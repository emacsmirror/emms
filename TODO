* Makefile.am (dist): With autotools, it is necessary at the
  moment to create a zip archive already at the `dist'
  target (i. e. not only at the `release' target). Is this a
  major nuisance?

* Makefile.am (release): Remove temporary upload.lftp;
  replace "$(distdir).{tar.gz,zip}.directive.asc" with
  proper temporary file and name files to upload explicitly.

* doc/Makefile.am (emms.info): Previously, `makeinfo' was
  called with `--no-split'. Is it necessary?

* lisp/Makefile.am (emms-autoloads.el/*.elc): Previously,
  `emacs' was called with `--no-site-file'. Is it necessary?
