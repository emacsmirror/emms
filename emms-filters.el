;;; Commentary:
;; This code allows you to filter and search the metadata cache.
;; This manages the search and filter functionalities of emms-browser.

;; Usage
;; -------------------------------------------------------------------
;; Use filters as before with <> keys to cycle the filter ring in the browser buffer.
;; Search-by something to create a new cache, or emms-filters-push to get started
;; building a filter.
;;
;; Use 'emms-filters-status-print' to watch the stacks and filters in effect.

;; Use 'emms-filters-show-filter-menu' to see a list of all filters known
;; organized by factory.
;;
;; Apply a filter with the functions
;;    emms-filters-push, emms-filters-or, emms-filters-and, emms-filters-and-not
;;    emms-filters-smash and emms-filters-one-shot.
;;
;; manipulate the stack with the functions:
;; emms-filters-push, emms-filters-pop, emms-filters-clear and emms-filters-squash, swap and swap-pop.
;;
;; Interactively create and use new filters by choosing 'new filter'
;; in the filter selection lists.
;;
;; The function `emms-filters-current-meta-filter' gives the multi-filter data source
;; for the the current filter.
;;
;; A filter can be 'kept'. The function 'emms-filters-keep will create and register
;; a multi-filter of the current filter, adding it to the multi-filter menu.
;; This only lasts until the current Emacs session ends.
;; If emms-filters-multi-filter-save-file is set, a usable multi-filter definition will also be
;; appended to the file.
;;
;; Manage the search cache with emms-filters-hard-filter, emms-filters-one-shot, emms-filters-quick-one-shot,
;; emms-filters-search-by, emms-filters-pop-cache, emms-filters-squash-caches,
;; emms-filters-clear-caches, emms-filters-push-cache
;;
;; Caches can be stashed for the session and pushed back to the stack
;; at any time. The Emms-cache-DB is the default.
;;
;; Switch the active ring filter with <> which correspond to
;; emms-filters-next-ring-filter and emms-filters-previous-ring-filter.
;;
;; The filter stack can be cleared with emms-filters-clear, the caches
;; with emms-filters-clear-caches and the ring with emms-filters-clear-ring-filter.
;;
;; All stacks and filters can be cleared with 'emms-filters-clear-all


;; Some Definitions:
;; -------------------------------------------------------------------
;;    Filtering:  Displaying the narrowed results from looking for matches
;;                in a list of items.
;;    Search:
;;       The saving of the narrowed results created from filtering a list of items,
;;       such that future filtering and searching will have a smaller list of items.
;;
;;    Filter or filter cons,  a cons of the form (name . function)
;;         Registration takes care of this.
;;         Once a filter is properly constructed it will be a cons
;;         (name . filter-function) the functions are created with one of the
;;         filter factories.
;;
;;    Filter function - a function that takes a track as its argument
;;      and returns true or False.
;;
;;    Filter Factory: A function which creates a filter function given the
;;      the desired parameters.
;;
;;    Multi-filter:  A filter factory which is other filters combined
;;                   using Or, And as well as And-Not.
;;
;;    Meta-filter: A multi-filter data definition.
;;       The filter stack uses meta-filters in a cons
;;       like this; (name . meta-filter).
;;       Filter names for meta-filters can be easily constructed.
;;
;;       This meta-filter uses 4 filters by name:
;;
;;            '(("Vals" "Milonga")
;;              ("1900-1929" "1929-1937"))
;;
;;       This filter will
;;       Match on genre of vals OR
;;                         milonga AND
;;                             any year between
;;                         1900-1929 OR
;;                         1929-1937.
;;
;;       Making one or more multi-filter is easy.
;;       (emms-filters-make-filters
;;        '(("Multi-filter"
;;           "Vals | milonga - 1900-1937"
;;           (("Vals" "Milonga")
;;            ("1900-1929" "1929-1937")))));

;;    Meta-filter-stack:  An interactive stack of meta-filters which allow
;;      the creation, combination and use of all filters.
;;
;;    Filter-ring: A ring of filter names, which can be easily selected with
;;       next and previous controls. All filters created through
;;       'emms-browser-make-filter are added here by default.
;;
;;       The filter ring replaces the functionality of emms-browser-filters.
;;       The easiest way to make the filter ring is with a list of filters.
;;       (emms-filters-make-filter-ring '("Tango" "Vals" "Milonga"))


;; Backward compatibility:
;; -------------------------------------------------------------------
;; This code replaces both emms-browser filters and search-by.
;; emms-browser-make-filter and search-by use emms-filters for their
;; current functionality.
;;
;; Emms-browser-filter functions are specified to return an inverted value.
;; emms-browser-make-filter is a slightly different mechanism from emms-filters.el.
;; but has been modified to pass its filters to emms-filters.
;; Those filters will be properly inverted and added to emms-filters-filters and to the
;; emms-filters-filter-ring. This should provide a seamless experience for previous users
;; of emms-browser filtering. As the emms-filters-filter-ring is functionally equivalent.
;;
;; Search-by was just one filter factory, 'fields-search', and searches are
;; not inverted. The only real difference between a filter and a search was
;; that a filter was rendered and a search was saved for subsequent filtering.
;; The equivalent to the emms-browser search-by is just a one shot
;; interactive new fields-search factory filter that saves a cache.
;;
;; Filters are slightly different when coded for emms-filters.
;; 1. They should return true if they match the tracks
;; 2. The factory should wrap the lambda in a lexical-let.
;; 3. The factory and the filters must both be registered with emms-filters.
;;    This provides a higher level of interaction with the filters.
;; 4. There is no difference between a search function and a filter function.


;; The moving parts.
;; -------------------------------------------------------------------
;; Emms-filters consists of a few different mechanisms.
;; There are factories to make filters. There is the filter stack
;; to manage the creation and use of filters.
;;
;; There is the cache stack to handle the saving of a current filtered results
;; into a reduced database cache for subsequent searches.
;;
;; There is the filter ring for quickly switching between commonly used filters.
;;
;; - Filter Factories - To make filters, which are lambda functions.
;;                      Factories are frequently made from other factories.
;; - Filters - To be used by the meta-filter stack to create more filters.
;;             filters are represeed simply as data, and are very easy to define.
;; - Filter menu - A customizable ring of factories and their rings of filters.
;; - Multi-filter - A filter factory to create Meta-filters, filters made of filters.
;; - Meta-filter - A multi-filter data definition. Also data, and easy to define.
;; - The filter stack - A meta-filter manipulator and multi-filter creator.
;; - The cache stack - A stack of database caches.
;; - The filter ring. - A subset of convenient to use filters.
;;                      For backward compatibility and convenience.


;;; Filter factories
;; -------------------------------------------------------------------
;; Filter factories make filters which are simply test functions which
;; take a track and return true or false.
;;
;; Factories are registered with the Emms-filter system so that they
;; have names that can be referenced later. Additionally, registration
;; includes a prompt and parameter definition. This allows the emms-filters
;; prompting system to provide an interactive interface to any filter factory.
;;
;; The prompting system allows the creation of any filter interactively at
;; any time.
;;
;; Here is the Genre Factory which is actually made from the
;; field-compare factory. This is a common pattern to create
;; a simpler factory from a more complex one. It is simply
;; a partial that is registered with a different set of prompts.
;; In this case Genre: is the prompt and it is expected to be a string.
;;
;; (emms-filters-register-filter-factory
;;  "Genre"
;;  (apply-partially 'emms-filters-make-filter-field-compare
;;                   'string-equal-ignore-case 'info-genre)
;;  '(("Genre: " (:string . nil))));;
;;
;; The actual filter factory is the field comparison factory.
;; This single function can be a new factory for any data field
;; using any comparison function we would like.
;;
;; Filter factories depend upon lexical context of their parameters. In
;; order to have data values that stick after function creation there
;; is lexical-let to ensure the factory behaves as expected.
;; This transfers the values to local values and uses them as normal
;; in the returned #'(lambda (track)...).
;;
;; (defun emms-filters-make-filter-field-compare (operator-func field compare-val)
;;   "Make a filter that compares FIELD to COMPARE-VALUE with OPERATOR-FUNC.
;; Works for number fields and string fields provided the appropriate
;; type match between values and the comparison function. Partials can
;; easily make more specific factory functions from this one."
;;   (lexical-let ((local-operator operator-func)
;;                 (local-field field)
;;                 (local-compare-val compare-val))
;;     #'(lambda (track)
;;         (let ((track-val (emms-track-get track local-field)))
;;           (and
;;            track-val
;;            (funcall local-operator local-compare-val track-val))))))

;; The registration for this factory is more complex because of the prompting
;; for all the parameters. By changing just the registration name and the
;; prompts we can create two factories, one for numbers and one for strings.
;; Note the use of the ` and , to force the select lists to resolve.
;;
;; (emms-filters-register-filter-factory "Number field compare"
;;                              'emms-filters-make-filter-field-compare
;;                              ;; prompts
;;                              `(("Compare Function: "
;;                                 (:function . ,emms-filters-number-compare-functions))
;;                                ("Field name: "
;;                                 (:symbol . ,emms-filters-number-field-names))
;;                                ("Compare to: "
;;                                 (:number . nil))))
;;
;;
;; Making a filter from a factory is easy.
;;
;; (emms-filters-make-filter "Genre" "My Genre filter" "Somevalue")
;;
;; Or make a lot of filters at once.
;;
;; (emms-filters-make-filters '(("Genre" "Waltz"      "waltz")
;;                     ("Genre" "Salsa"      "salsa")
;;                     ("Genre" "Blues"      "blues")
;;                     ("Genre" "Jazz"       "jazz")))
;;
;; Or just push a filter onto the stack with emms-filters-push,
;; select 'new filter' and follow the prompts.

;;; Factory Prompts.
;;; Interactive factory prompting for filter building.
;; -------------------------------------------------------------------
;; Registering a factory associates a name, a function and a list of
;; prompt definitions so that we may create filters interactively by name.
;;
;; The factory prompt data is used to interactively create new filters.
;; A prompt is  (prompt (type . select-list)) if there is no
;; select list we read a string and coerce the value to the correct
;; type as needed.  :number, :string, :list :symbol :function
;; are the coercion type choices.
;;
;; Here is a simple factory registration for the Genre filter factory function.
;; Which takes a single string parameter.
;;
;; (emms-filters-register-filter-factory "Genre"
;;                              emms-filters-make-filter-genre
;;                              '(("Genre: " (:string . nil))))
;;
;; Parameters are of the form: '((prompt (type . select-list)) ... )
;;
;; The following prompt will coerce the value it receives into a number.
;;
;; '(("Days: " (:number . nil)))
;;
;; The compare field factory takes a compare function,
;; an :info-field specifier and a string to compare.
;; Note the use of ` and , in order to resolve the selection lists here.
;; It uses the convenience variables which hold the compare functions and
;; string field names.
;;
;; `(("Compare Function:"
;;    (:function . ,emms-filters-string-compare-functions))
;;   ("Field name:"
;;    (:symbol . ,emms-filters-string-field-names))
;;   ("Compare to:"
;;    (:string . nil)));;
;;

;; The Filter stack
;; -------------------------------------------------------------------
;; The filter stack builds more complex filters as you push filters to it.
;; Adding to the filter or replacing it with another push continues to add filters
;; to the filter stack. To return to the previous filter simply pop the stack.
;;
;; To use a filter, emms-filters-push it to create a new current filter on the stack.
;; It will become a meta-filter on the filter stack
;; and the current active filter will be a multi-filter version of it.
;;
;; The filter ring works independently of the filter stack. Each re-filtering of
;; tracks uses the current ring filter and the current filter together.
;;
;; A filter can be 'kept'. The function 'emms-filters-keep will create and register
;; a multi-filter of the current filter, adding it to the multi-filter menu.
;; This only lasts until the current Emacs session ends.
;; If emms-filters-multi-filter-save-file is set, a usable filter definition will be
;; appended to the file.
;;
;; Other commands for manipulating the stack.
;;    Push, pop, squash, clear, swap, swap-pop, smash


;;; The Search Cache Stack
;; --------------------------------------------------
;; The cache stack is a simply a stack of emms-cache-db style hash tables.
;; Each entry is a subset of the master emms-cache-db created through filtering.
;; Their names are constructed from the filters which created them.
;;
;; Filtering and displaying of tracks is done against the top cache on the stack.
;;
;; The function; emms-filters-hard-filter creates a cache from the current filter
;; and cache, and pushes it to the stack.
;;
;; By using emms-filters-one-shot, emms-filters-quick-one-shot and emms-filters-browser-search
;; also create caches on the stack. These functions allow effective
;; emulation of the previous EMMS-Browser search functionalities.
;;
;; The usual commands exist for manipulating the stack.
;;    Pop, squash, clear, swap, swap-pop, push-cache

;; Additionally there is a stash option. This pops and stashes the current
;; cache to be retrieved later. The stashed cache will become a selection
;; for the push-cache command.
;;
;; A one-shot filter combined with a factory name is 'emms-filters-quick-one-shot.
;;
;; The function 'emms-filters-browser-search is a 'emms-filters-quick-one-shot with the
;; fields-search filter factory.
;;
;; This effectively emulates the former emms-browser search behavior of
;; quickly prompting, filtering and saving a cache by pushing a filter,
;; hard-filter then pop.


;; How it works.
;; -------------------------------------------------------------------
;; To begin simply do an emms-filters-push.  This will present the filter factory ring.
;; Choose a factory, an already existing filter or 'New' and follow the prompts.
;;
;; Filters which are created interactively can be kept for the session
;; with emms-filters-keep.  One shots, (searches), are automatically kept for the session.
;; Keep may also write them to a file for later use.
;;
;; Push a filter to the filter stack with emms-filters-push and then
;; add to it with the emms-filters-or, emms-filters-and, and emms-filters-and-not functions.
;; Each change results in new filter on the stack.
;;
;; Use emms-filters-or to add another filter and choose 'new filter' to
;; interactively create and add a filter to the current filter.
;;
;; Add in an extra layer of quick switch filtering with next and previous
;; filter-ring filters.  The filter ring filters can be accessed with
;; < and >.
;;
;; You may want to keep your results for a while, or you may
;; wish to start with a clear search for a name, either way,
;; a hard-filter will push a cache-db onto the cache stack.
;;
;; Subsequent filtering continues with this new DB cache. A cache can also
;; be pushed to the stack with a one-shot function. One shots
;; make, use, cache, and then pop a filter, leaving a new cache and the filter
;; stack as it was.
;;
;; Create a new factory function, register it in
;; emms-filters-factories along with its parameters and prompts.
;; From this point on filters can be created interactively by selecting
;; to push a new filter, and choosing the new factory.
;;
;; In code use emms-filters-make-filter or emms-filters-make-filters to use the factory by name.

;; Filter stack interaction
;; -------------------------------------------------------------------
;; To interactively create a filter, start with a push.
;; The filter stack itself is the interactive filter factory for multi-filters.
;;
;; Choose a factory, then an existing filter or 'new filter' and follow the prompts.
;;
;; Do an emms-filters-or to add another possible match or emms-filters-and or
;; emms-filters-and-not to add a restriction. Build the filter how you like.
;;
;; When a new filter is pushed, it turns into a meta filter
;; and is pushed on the filter stack. A filter function is made from
;; the entire stack's multi-filter and set to be the current filter,
;; and the browser is asked to re-render the results.
;;
;; Any change to the stack causes a re-render with the new current filter.
;;
;; Use emms-filters-status or the emms-filter-hydra to see the stacks and
;; current filters.

;; Making Filters from factories, in code.
;; -------------------------------------------------------------------
;; Filter factories include the following. Most common filters can be
;; easily constructed from these. The number of available filters is too
;; numerous to list. For instance, a filter already exists for every
;; track type and there many common genres and year range filters.
;;
;; Filter factories like artist, album artist, composer, Names, etc.
;; are all just specialized field compare or fields search factories.
;;
;; Factories
;; ----------
;; Album
;; Album-artist
;; All text fields
;; Artist
;; Artists
;; Artists and composer
;; Composer
;; Directory
;; Duration less
;; Duration more
;; Fields search
;; Genre
;; Greater than Year
;; Less than Year
;; Multi-filter
;; Names
;; Names and titles
;; Not played since
;; Notes
;; Number field compare
;; Orchestra
;; Performer
;; Played since
;; String field compare
;; Title
;; Titles
;; Track type
;; Year range

;; Filters also have names, and are added
;; to their respective factory's filter selection menu.
;; here are some example filter definitions.
;;
;; ;; Filters are easily described as data.
;; ;;        factory      Name        arguments

;; Each entry is a subset of the master emms-cache-db created through filtering.
;; Their names are constructed from the filters which created them.
;;
;; Filtering and displaying of tracks is done against the top cache on the stack.
;;
;; A cache of the current filter results can be pushed to the cache stack at any
;; time with hard-filter. These results will reflect the current meta-filter
;; as well as the filter currently chosen in the filter ring.
;;
;; A one-shot filter combined with a hard filter is emms-filters-quick-one-shot.
;; This effectively emulates the former emms-browser search behavior of
;; filtering and saving a cache by pushing a filter, hard-filter, pop.
