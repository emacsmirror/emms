;;; Commentary:

;; Display playing time on mode line, it looks like: 01:32/04:09.

;; Put this file into your load-path and the following into your
;; ~/.emacs:
;;     (require 'emms-playing-time)
;;     (emms-playing-time 1)

;; Note: `(emms-playing-time -1)' will disable emms-playing-time
;; module completely, and is not recommended (since some other emms
;; modules may rely on it, such as `emms-lastfm.el').

;; Instead, to toggle displaying playing time on mode line, one could
;; call `emms-playing-time-enable-display' and
;; `emms-playing-time-disable-display'."
