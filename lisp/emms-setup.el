;;; Commentary:

;; This file provides the `emms-setup' feature.  With `emms-setup' we
;; can setup Emms with different features enabled.  The use of this
;; feature is documented in the Emms manual which is distributed with
;; Emms.
;;
;; The use this feature we can invoke (for example):
;;
;;         (require 'emms-setup)
;;         (emms-all)
;;
;; The first command loads the feature into Emacs and the second
;; chooses the `emms-all' level.
