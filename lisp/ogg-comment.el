;;; Commentary:
;; This file provides a minimal interface to reading the "comment"
;; section from an Ogg-Vorbis stream as defined in
;; <URL:http://www.xiph.org/ogg/vorbis/doc/Vorbis_I_spec.html>.  It
;; relies on all the comments being in the first 28 KBytes of the
;; file, thus removing the need to read the whole ogg file into an
;; Emacs buffer.

;; The implementation is rather "byte-oriented", due to the way the
;; Ogg-Vorbis file headers are specified.  Any improvements in making
;; the implementation more emacsy would be welcomed.

;;; Installation:
;; To use, put this file somewhere in your `load-path' and do
;; (require 'ogg-comment).
;; You can then read ogg comments from a file by doing:
;; M-x oggc-show-header RET.

;;; History:
;;

;;; TODO:
;; o Read setup header, to get bitrate and such like.
;; o Make writing comments possible.

;;; Code:
