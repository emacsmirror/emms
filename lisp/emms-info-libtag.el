;;; Commentary:

;; This code has been adapted from code found in mp3player.el, written
;; by Jean-Philippe Theberge (jphiltheberge@videotron.ca), Mario
;; Domgoergen (kanaldrache@gmx.de) and Jorgen Schäfer
;; <forcer@forcix.cx>.

;; To activate this method for getting info, use something like:

;; (require 'emms-info-libtag)
;; (add-to-list 'emms-info-functions 'emms-info-libtag)

;; Note that you should remove emms-info-mp3info and emms-info-ogginfo
;; from the emms-info-functions list if you want to avoid conflicts.
;; For example, to set libtag as your exclusive info provider:

;; (setq emms-info-functions '(emms-info-libtag))

;;; Code:

(require 'emms-info)

(defvar emms-info-libtag-coding-system 'utf-8)
(defvar emms-info-libtag-program-name "emms-print-metadata")

(defun emms-info-libtag (track)
  (when (and (eq 'file (emms-track-type track))
             (string-match
              "\\.\\([Mm][Pp]3\\|[oO][gG][gG]\\|[fF][lL][aA][cC]\\|[sS][pP][xX]\\)\\'"
              (emms-track-name track)))
    (with-temp-buffer
      (when (zerop
             (let ((coding-system-for-read 'utf-8))
               (call-process emms-info-libtag-program-name
                             nil '(t nil) nil
                             (emms-track-name track))))
