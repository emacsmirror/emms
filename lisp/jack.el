;;; Commentary:

;; JACK is a low-latency audio server, written for POSIX conformant
;; operating systems such as GNU/Linux and Apple's OS X. It can connect a
;; number of different applications to an audio device, as well as
;; allowing them to share audio between themselves. Its clients can run in
;; their own processes (ie. as normal applications), or they can run
;; within the JACK server (ie. as a "plugin").
;;
;; JACK was designed from the ground up for professional audio work, and
;; its design focuses on two key areas: synchronous execution of all
;; clients, and low latency operation.
;;
;; jack.el provides a facility for starting jackd from within Emacs.
;; It also provides convenience functions for prompting the user for
;; jack client and port names in the minibuffer, as well as the
;; functions `jack-connect' and `jack-disconnect' which can be used to
;; rearrange jack port wiring with a minimum of keystrokes.
