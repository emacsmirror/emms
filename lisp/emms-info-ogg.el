;;; Commentary:

;; This file provides an interface to retrieving comments from
;; ogg-files, using Lawrence Mitchell's ogg-comment.el.

;; To activate, put something like this in your ~/.emacs:

;; (require 'emms-info-ogg)
;; (add-to-list 'emms-info-methods-list 'emms-info-ogg)

;; You'll of course need to also have a player if you want to actually
;; play the files.

;;; Code:

(require 'emms-info)
(require 'ogg-comment)
