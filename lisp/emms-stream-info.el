;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Set `*emms-stream-info-backend*' to either 'vlc or 'mplayer, which
;; are the two currently supported backends for retrieving stream
;; information.  You can then either call `emms-stream-info-message'
;; directly or hit "i" in the `emms-streams' buffer over stream you
;; want to investigate.
;;
;; Note that you do not have to be playing the stream in question in
;; order to find out what is playing on it since this library will
;; open its own connection to the streaming server.
;;
;; Please send bug reports and stations which do not work to the
;; maintainer (email at the top of this file).

;;; History:
;;
;; This library was re-implemented from scratch around January of
;; 2009.  If you are looking for the old code then grab source code
;; older than that.

;;; Code:
