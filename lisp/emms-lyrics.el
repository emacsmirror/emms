;;; Commentary:

;; This package enables you to play music files and display lyrics
;; synchronously! :-)  Plus, it provides a `emms-lyrics-mode' for
;; making lyric files.

;; Put this file into your load-path and the following into your
;; ~/.emacs:
;;
;;             (require 'emms-lyrics)
;;
;; Then either `M-x emms-lyrics-enable RET' or add (emms-lyrics 1) in
;; your ~/.emacs to enable.

;;; TODO:

;; 1. Maybe the lyric setup should run before `emms-start'.
;; 2. Give the user a chance to choose when finding multiple lyrics.
;; 3. Search .lrc format lyrics on the internet?

;;; Code:

(require 'emms)
(require 'emms-player-simple)
(require 'emms-source-file)
(require 'time-date)
(require 'emms-url)
