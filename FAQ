Frequently Asked Questions about emms.  Please read this before

Q: I seem unable to play files with accents in them.  Why?
A: Emacs doesn't know the coding system of your files, and it
   apparently decodes them the wrong way.  Set
   `default-file-name-coding-system' to the correct encoding of your
   file names.  It might even work to set it to 'undecided and let
   Emacs guess.

Q: Emms skips some songs in the playlist for no apparent reason.  When
   I select them manually, everything works.  Why?
A: Increase `emms-player-delay' until it works.  The problem is that
   emms is told by Emacs that a player finished, so it starts a new
   one.  But in reality, the player has not yet freed the audio
   device, so the next player gets an error when trying to play.  The
   best way to fix this by using ALSA or other sound systems which
   allow concurrent access.
