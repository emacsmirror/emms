This is an explanation of how to make a release for Emms. Emms is
developed at Savannah (https://savannah.gnu.org/projects/emms/) and
distributed via Emacs ELPA (https://elpa.gnu.org/).

* clean compilation
Check for clean compilation on the two latest major Emacs releases.


* check for basic functionality
Check for clean loading and running with basic functionality on the
two latest major Emacs releases.


* version bump
Increase the version number in emms.el (`emms-version' and the elpa
header as a comment).


* NEWS
update the NEWS file from the git log to include all significant
user-facing changes.


* contributors
Update AUTHORS file with the names of any new contributors. This is a
good chance to make sure we are releasing everything with proper
copyleft.


* update the manual
Update the manual:

    $ makeinfo --html --no-split emms.texinfo

Make sure that the manual compiles cleanly and that it looks right.


* website update
Update the website with all any pertinent information. Upload a new
version of the manual if it has changed in this release:

    $ cvs commit -m "update website" index.html


* tag release and push the tag
Tag the release in git, for example:

    $ git tag -a 4.2 -m "4.2"
    $ git push --tags origin "4.2"


* push to repo
Push the version update itself to the git repo. We have automatic
synchronization set up for GNU ELPA, so we are done.


* announce
Announce the release in the emms mailing list if it is called for.
