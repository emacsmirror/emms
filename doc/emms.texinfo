@node Introduction
@chapter Introduction

@cindex introduction

Emms is the Emacs Multi-Media System. Emms organizes playlists, allows
browsing through track and album metadata, and plays files by calling
external players.

This manual tries to be the definitive source of information about
Emms, an online version of the manual is available at:
@uref{http://www.gnu.org/software/emms/manual/}.

The basic functionality of Emms consists of three parts: The core, the
sources, and the players.

The core resides in @file{emms.el}, and provides a simple playlist and the
basic functionality to use all the other features of Emms. It provides
the common user commands and interfaces for other parts. It thinks in
tracks, where a track is the combination of a type and a name - e.g.
the track type 'file has a name that is the file name. Other track
types are possible.

To get to tracks, the core needs sources. The file @file{emms-source-file.el}
provides simple sources to interact with the file system.

When Emms finally has the sources in the playlist, it needs a player
to play them. @file{emms-player-simple.el} defines a few useful players, and
allows you to define your own in a very simple way.

The Emms core comes with many additional features to extend its
functionality.

The way Emms works is easy to customize with your own code or by using
`M-x customize' or by changing the variables directly.


@c -------------------------------------------------------------------
@node Quickstart Guide
@chapter Quickstart Guide

This chapter demonstrates how to setup Emms so that you can start
listening to your music without having to read all of the
documentation first. This is the tl;dr version of the manual.

The first thing you have to do is telling Emacs where Emms is
located. Let's say you have it in @file{~/elisp/emms/}. So add this
line to your @file{.emacs}:

@lisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "~/elisp/emms/lisp/")
@end lisp

More detailed information about installing Emms can be found in the
installation chapter, @xref{Installation}.

You'll then want to load Emms into Emacs. To achieve this you invoke
the @code{emms-all} setup function by adding the following three lines
to your @file{.emacs}.

@lisp
(require 'emms-setup)
(emms-all)
(emms-default-players)
@end lisp

The function @code{emms-default-players} in the last line sets up the
list of default players. The list contains lightweight specialized
players like ogg123 or mpg321 and we-play-everything-players such as
mplayer, mpv, vlc, etc.. To be sure that emms can play all your music
you should check that your preferred players are installed on the
machine.

More detail about setting up Emms can be found in the setup chapter,
@xref{Setup}.

Emms tries to display the tags (the name of the song, as opposed to
the name of the file) of the music you listen to. Emms can use a
number of pieces of software and libraries as sources for track info,
see @xref{Track Information} for more.

The last thing to do is to tell Emms where your music is; the root
directory of our music collection. Let's say all your music is in
@file{~/Music} or in subdirectories thereof.

@lisp
(setq emms-source-file-default-directory "~/Music/")
@end lisp

OK, now we've set up Emms. Reload your @file{.emacs} or restart Emacs to
let the changes have an effect.

Now we will add all our music to a playlist by invoking @kbd{M-x
emms-add-directory-tree RET ~/Music/ RET}. We do this because then
Emms will read the tags of all your music files and caches them (this
is also required for the Emms browser, @xref{The Browser}.)

To switch to the playlist buffer, invoke @kbd{M-x
emms-playlist-mode-go} or simply @kbd{M-x emms}. You may see that some
tracks are displayed with their file name, but as Emms populates its
tag cache, track by track, the filenames get replaced with the artist
and track name of the file's tag.

Go ahead and navigate to a track and hit @kbd{RET} on it to start
playback.

Now you can start exploring Emms. It's probably best to begin with the
basic commands (@pxref{Basic Commands}), the interactive playlists
(@pxref{Interactive Playlists}), and the browser (@pxref{The Browser}).


@c -------------------------------------------------------------------
@node Installation
@chapter Installation

@cindex installation

Emms is available via GNU ELPA, which takes care of all of the
following steps automatically.

If you are installing Emms manually, you need to put all the .el files
of emms in a directory in your load-path. For example, if you put all
those files into ~/elisp/emms/, then in your ~/.emacs, you should add:

@lisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "~/elisp/emms/lisp/")
@end lisp
@noindent

@menu
* Compiling Emms::      Compiling Emms into Byte-Code.
@end menu



@node Compiling Emms
@section Compiling Emms

@cindex compiling

If you are using XEmacs, you will need to edit @file{Makefile} as
follows before continuing.

@example
EMACS=xemacs
SITEFLAG=-no-site-file
@end example

You can byte-compile Emms by first entering the directory containing the
Emms source code, followed by invoking:

@command{make}

Which will byte compile Emms. You can then invoke:

@command{make install}

Which will install Emms into your Emacs directories (provided you have
the appropriate permissions to do so on your system).

Note that Emms is a light-weight and agile program, you can therefore
run Emms just fine without byte compiling it.


@c -------------------------------------------------------------------
@node Setup
@chapter Setup

@cindex setup
@cindex setting up Emms
@cindex quick setup

The `emms-setup' feature is provided by the file
@file{emms-setup.el}. It is essentially a collection of shortcuts for
loading different Emms features quickly, but everything you can do
with `emms-setup' can also be done manually.

We use `emms-setup' by calling one of the setup functions.

@defun emms-minimalistic
An Emms setup script.
Playlists and all the basics for playing media, but nothing else.
@end defun

@defun emms-all
An Emms setup script.
Loads all the stable features which come with the Emms distribution.
@end defun

`emms-setup' also comes with a convenience function to set a default
list of media players.

@defun emms-default-players
Set @var{emms-player-list} to @var{emms-setup-default-player-list}.
@end defun

You can of course write your own Emms setup functions like the above
by looking at the existing function definitions in
@file{emms-setup.el}.


@c -------------------------------------------------------------------
@node Configuration
@chapter Configuration

@cindex Configuration

This chapter discusses the configuration of Emms in more detail.

The following code fragment provides a minimal Emms setup without
using the layer of `emms-setup'. It can maybe be used to better
understand the internals of Emms. You can see how Emms needs to know
about players (these are defined in `emms-player-simple') and about
sources for tracks (trivial file system based sources, such as this
`emms-directory-tree', are defined in `emms-source-file').

@lisp
(require 'emms-player-simple)
(require 'emms-source-file)
(require 'emms-source-playlist)
(setq emms-player-list '(emms-player-mpg321
                         emms-player-ogg123
                         emms-player-mplayer))
@end lisp

For a discussion on how to define additional players, see @xref{Simple
Players}.

Much of the behaviour of Emms can be changed by setting
variables. For example:

@lisp
(setq emms-info-asynchronously nil)
(setq emms-playlist-buffer-name "*Music*")
@end lisp

The first @code{setq} turns off the asynchronous updating of info tags. The
second sets the default name of the Emms playlist buffer.

Another way to change Emms variables is to use the M-x
@command{customize} mechanism provided by Emacs.

@menu
* Finding files and speed::     Finding files quickly or portably.
@end menu



@node Finding files and speed
@section Finding files and speed

@cindex files
@cindex speed

Emms needs to traverse directories in order to find playable
media. The default method Emms uses to achieve this is
@code{emms-source-file-directory-tree-internal} as defined in
@file{emms-source-file.el}.  The above method is written portably and
will always work, but might be too slow if we want to load several
hundred tracks (or more).

@file{emms-source-file.el} defines another method for finding files,
@code{emms-source-file-directory-tree-find} which uses
GNU/find. @code{emms-source-file-directory-tree-find} is usually an
order of magnitude faster, but of course will not work if you do not
have GNU/find installed.

The method Emms will use is defined in the customisable variable
@var{emms-source-file-directory-tree-function}.

@node Getting Help
@chapter Getting Help

@cindex mailing list
@cindex website

If you have a bug to report, need help, or wish to suggest a feature,
please feel free to use the Emms mailing list.  The address of the list
is emms-help@@gnu.org.  To subscribe to it, visit
@url{http://lists.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/emms-help}.

If you are familiar with the Gmane service, there is a Gmane newsgroup
which mirrors this mailing address at gmane.emacs.emms.user.

Emms also has a website at @url{http://www.gnu.org/software/emms/}.


@c -------------------------------------------------------------------
@node Formats and Freedom
@chapter Formats and Freedom

@cindex freedom
@cindex format

Emms is free software, but some of the file formats it can play carry
restrictions, they are proprietary file formats. Proprietary software
companies are pushing out audio and video formats which restrict when,
where and how you can play them, and restrict developers from writing
free software which interacts with them.

Restrictive file formats put the corporate bottom-line before the
public interest.

Fortunately there are alternatives like Ogg. Ogg is a professional
grade multimedia format. Ogg Vorbis is the compressed audio format
(like MP3), and Ogg Theora is the video format. For more information,
go to @url{http://www.xiph.org/}.

If you want to transcode audio into a lossless format, you can try
FLAC (Free Lossless Audio Codec). FLAC stands out as the fastest and
most widely supported lossless audio codec, and the only one that at
once is non-proprietary, is unencumbered by patents and has the source
code for a reference implementation freely available. For more
information about FLAC, go to @url{http://flac.sourceforge.net/}.


@c -------------------------------------------------------------------
@node Basic Commands
@chapter Basic Commands

@cindex basic commands
@cindex commands, basic

Before you can use the interface commands, you need a playlist to
start with. The following commands allow you to add to the current
playlist from different sources:

Note that the commands with the ``emms-add-'' prefix add the source to
the playlist but do not start playing it immediately. Conversely, the
commands with the ``emms-play-'' prefix begin playing the track
immediately.

@defun emms-play-file file
A source for a single file - either @var{file}, or queried from the
user. If called with a prefix the file will be added like
@command{emms-add-file}.
@end defun
@defun emms-add-file file
A source for a single file - either @var{file}, or queried from
the user. If called with a prefix the file will be played like
@command{emms-play-file}.
@end defun
@defun emms-play-directory dir
A source for a whole directory tree - either @var{dir}, or queried
from the user.
@end defun
@defun emms-add-directory dir
A source for a whole directory tree - either @var{dir}, or queried
from the user.
@end defun
@defun emms-play-directory-tree dir
A source for multiple directory trees - either @var{dir}, or the
value of @var{emms-source-file-default-directory}.
@end defun
@defun emms-add-directory-tree dir
A source for multiple directory trees - either @var{dir}, or the
value of @var{emms-source-file-default-directory}.
@end defun
@defun emms-play-url url
A source for an @var{url} - for example, for streaming.
@end defun
@defun emms-add-url url
A source for an @var{url} - for example, for streaming.
@end defun
@defun emms-play-playlist playlist
A source for the M3u or PLS playlist format from the file @var{playlist}.
@end defun
@defun emms-add-playlist playlist
A source for the M3u or PLS playlist format from the file @var{playlist}.
@end defun
@defun emms-play-find dir regexp
A source that will find files in @var{dir} or
@var{emms-source-file-default-directory} which match @var{regexp}.
@end defun
@defun emms-add-find dir regexp
A source that will find files in @var{dir} or
@var{emms-source-file-default-directory} which match @var{regexp}.
@end defun

The basic functionality of Emms is just to play music without being
noticed. It provides a few commands to skip the current track and
such, but other than that it doesn't show up. Emms provides the
following basic user commands (which you might want to bind to
keystrokes):

@defun emms-start
Start playing the current playlist
@end defun
@defun emms-stop
Stop playing
@end defun
@defun emms-next
Start playing the next track in the playlist
@end defun
@defun emms-previous
Start playing previous track in the playlist
@end defun
@defun emms-shuffle
Shuffle the current playlist. This uses
@var{emms-playlist-shuffle-function}.
@end defun
@defun emms-sort
Sort the current playlist. This uses
@var{emms-playlist-sort-function}.
@end defun
@defun emms-show &optional insertp
Describe the current Emms track in the minibuffer. If @var{insertp} is
non-nil, insert the description into the current buffer instead. This
function uses @var{emms-show-format} to format the current track.
@end defun

The command @command{emms-show-all} will pop up a window with the
complete information about the track being
played. @command{emms-show-all} is provided by
@file{emms-show-all.el}, which is included in the `emms-all' setup
level. See @xref{Setup}.

@defopt emms-player-list
A list of players Emms can use. You need to set this in order to use
Emms to play media.
@end defopt
@defopt emms-show-format
The format to use for @command{emms-show}. Any "%s" is replaced by
what @var{emms-track-description-function} returns for the currently
playing track.
@end defopt
@defopt emms-repeat-playlist
Non-nil if the Emms playlist should automatically repeat the playlist.
If nil, playback will stop when the last track finishes playing.
@end defopt
@defopt emms-track-description-function
Function for describing an Emms track in a user-friendly way.
@end defopt
@defopt emms-sort-lessp-function
A function that compares two tracks, and returns non-nil if the first
track should be sorted before the second (see also @code{sort}).
@end defopt



@node Hooks
@section Hooks

@cindex hooks
@cindex adding functionality

The core file provides hook variables for the basic functionality of
Emms.

@defopt emms-player-started-hook
A hook run when an Emms player started playing.
@end defopt
@defopt emms-player-stopped-hook
A hook run when an Emms player stopped playing. See also
@var{emms-player-finished-hook}.
@end defopt
@defopt emms-playlist-source-inserted-hook
Hook run when a source got inserted into the playlist. The buffer is
narrowed to the new tracks.
@end defopt
@defopt emms-playlist-selection-changed-hook
Hook run after another track is selected in the Emms playlist.
@end defopt
@defopt emms-playlist-cleared-hook
Hook run after the current Emms playlist is cleared. This happens both
when the playlist is cleared and when a new buffer is created for it.
@end defopt
@defopt emms-player-finished-hook
Hook run when an Emms player finishes playing a track. Please pay
attention to the differences between @var{emms-player-finished-hook}
and @var{emms-player-stopped-hook}. The former is called only when the
player is stopped interactively; the latter, only when the player
actually finishes playing a track.
@end defopt
@defopt emms-player-paused-hook
Hook run when a player is paused or resumed. Use
@var{emms-player-paused-p} to find the current state.
@end defopt



@node Core Functions
@section Core Functions

@cindex core functions
@cindex basic functions

The core file also defines all the functions important to the basic
use of Emms.

There are functions which deal with movement in the playlist.

@defun emms-next-noerror
Start playing the next track in the Emms playlist. Unlike
@code{emms-next}, this function doesn't signal an error when called at
the end of the playlist. This function should only be called when no
player is playing. This is a good function to put in
@code{emms-player-finished-hook}.
@end defun
@defun emms-playlist-next
Move to the previous track in the current buffer.
@end defun
@defun emms-playlist-previous
Move to the previous track in the current buffer.
@end defun
@defun emms-random
Jump to a random track.
@end defun
@defun emms-toggle-repeat-playlist
Toggle whether emms repeats the playlist after it is done. See
@var{emms-repeat-playlist}.
@end defun
@defun emms-toggle-repeat-track
Toggle whether emms repeats the current track. See
@var{emms-repeat-track}.
@end defun
@defun emms-toggle-random-playlist
Toggle whether emms plays the tracks randomly or sequentially. See
@end defun
@var{emms-random-playlist}.

Some functions deal with the getting and setting track information.

@defun emms-track type name
Create a track with type @var{type} and name @var{name}.
@end defun
@defun emms-track-type track
Return the type of @var{track}.
@end defun
@defun emms-track-name track
Return the name of @var{track}.
@end defun
@defun emms-track-get name track &optional inexistent
Return the value of @var{name} for @var{track}. If there is no value,
return @var{default} (or nil, if not given).
@end defun
@defun emms-track-set track name value
Set the value of @var{name} for @var{track} to @var{value}.
@end defun
@defun emms-track-description track
Return a description of @var{track}. This function uses
@var{emms-track-description-function}.
@end defun
@defun emms-player-for track
Return an Emms player capable of playing @var{track}. This will be the
first player whose PLAYABLEP function returns non-nil, or nil if no
such player exists.
@end defun
@defun emms-playlist-current-selected-track
Return the currently selected track in the current playlist.
@end defun

There are also functions which deal with the playing itself.

@defun emms-player-start track
Start playing @var{track}.
@end defun
@defun emms-player-stop
Stop the currently playing player.
@end defun
@defun emms-player-stopped
Declare that the current Emms player is finished.
This should only be done by the current player itself.
@end defun
@defun emms-seek seconds
Seek the current player @var{seconds} seconds. This can be a floating
point number for sub-second fractions. It can also be negative to
seek backwards.
@end defun
@defun emms-seek-forward
Seek ten seconds forward.
@end defun
@defun emms-seek-backward
Seek ten seconds backward.
@end defun

@cindex organizing tracks and media

Emms uses Emacs buffers to store the media tracks for playing. We call
one such buffer a ``playlist buffer'' or an ``Emms playlist
buffer''. Emms then proceeds to play the media tracks in the buffer
from top to bottom until the end of the playlist.

The name of the playlist buffer is defined in the variable
@var{emms-playlist-buffer-name} and is set to be an invisible Emacs
buffer by default. You can change to any name you want. For an example
configuration see @xref{Configuration}.

You can create any number of playlist buffers you wish. At any time
Emms has a single ``current'' buffer through which it proceeds track
by track.

@defun emms-playlist-new &optional name
Create a new playlist buffer.
The buffer is named @var{name}, but made unique. @var{name} defaults
to `emms-playlist-buffer-name'. If called interactively, the new
buffer is also selected.
@end defun

@defun emms-playlist-save &optional format file
Store the current playlist to FILE as the type FORMAT.  The default
format is specified by @var{emms-source-playlist-default-format}.
@end defun

The current Emms playlist buffer is stored in the variable
@var{emms-playlist-buffer}.

@node Track Information
@chapter Track Information

@cindex track information
@cindex info tags

Without a way to read the embedded track information inside files,
Emms will only be able to list file names and file
locations. Therefore Emms is distributed with support for a number of
pieces of software and libraries which can be used to provide access
to track metadata such as the artist's name, track name, album title,
etc.

Emms can use a number of different ways to populate the playlist with
track information. These methods require the installation some
additional software, free software of course, that Emms can then call
to read the metadata from the files.

@itemize @bullet

@item
Tinytag, a small python utility. See @xref{Using tinytag}.

@item
Exiftool, written in perl. See @xref{Using exiftool}.

@item
The TagLib library can be used by compiling a small piece of ``shim''
software. See @xref{Using TagLib}.

@end itemize


You can also use a combination of format-specific tools if needed,
such as @file{emms-info-mp3info.el}, @file{emms-info-ogginfo.el},
@file{emms-info-opusinfo.el}, and @file{emms-cue.el}. These three
packages are front-ends for command-line tools. Ogg track information
is retrieved using the
@uref{http://directory.fsf.org/audio/ogg/vorbistools.html, ogginfo}
and the @uref{https://www.opus-codec.org/ opusinfo}
software. Likewise, mp3 track information is available using
@uref{http://www.ibiblio.org/mp3info/, mp3info}. @file{emms-cue.el}
retrieves tracks information for ape/flac files by parsing a cue sheet
file, which is plain text.

Automatic track information retrieval is enabled by default in the
`emms-all' setup level provided by @file{emms-setup.el}. For more
information about @file{emms-setup.el} see @xref{Setup}.

If you would like to know how Emms track retrieval works and how we
can define new methods for track retrieval see @xref{Defining Info
Methods}.

There are a number of user variables which control the behaviour of
`emms-info'.

@defopt emms-info-auto-update
Non-nil when Emms should update track information if the file changes.
This will cause hard drive activity on track loading. If this is too
annoying for you, set this variable to nil.
@end defopt
@defopt emms-info-asynchronously
Non-nil when track information should be loaded asynchronously. This
requires the feature `later-do' which is provided by the file
@file{later-do.el}, which comes with Emms.  See @var{later-do-batch} for
performance tweaking.
@end defopt
@defopt emms-info-functions
Functions which add information to tracks.  Each is called with a
track as argument.

@node Using TagLib
@section Using TagLib

@cindex using taglib

@file{emms-info-libtag.el} uses a tiny C shim (included in the src/
directory) program to take advantage of
@uref{http://taglib.github.io/, TagLib}.

The communication with the TagLib library is done via a tiny program
written in C++ @file{emms-print-metadata.cpp}, which comes with
Emms. To compile @file{emms-print-metadata} invoke:

@command{make emms-print-metadata}

The resultant binary will be installed when you invoke:

@command{make install} as in @xref{Compiling Emms}.

It is of course also possible to install only the
@file{emms-print-metadata} binary where your system can find and
execute it without installing all of Emms via the make command.

Once the binary is available load @code{emms-info-libtag} and make it
the @emph{only} info function with (note that if you have caching
enabled you may have to delete the existing cache and repopulate it in
order to see the TagLib data):

@node Defining Info Methods
@section Defining Info Methods

@cindex defining info methods

An info method essentially consists of a function which given an Emms
track returns the appropriate info for that track.

We can for example look at the predefined method for retrieving
information about audio tracks in the Ogg format.

The function @command{emms-info-ogginfo} provided by
@file{emms-info-ogginfo.el} accepts an Emms track as a single
argument and returns the appropriate information string.

We then register our info function with Emms by adding it to the
@var{emms-info-functions} list. The function will then be called at
the right time to provide track info.

@node Interactive Playlists
@chapter Interactive Playlists

@cindex Interactive Playlists

Emms provides a visual, interactive playlist mode as well as the
ability to use playlists without ever looking at then. This visual,
interactive mode is called the `emms-playlist-mode' and is defined in
@file{emms-playlist-mode.el}.

The interactive playlist mode is enabled by default in the `emms-all'
setup level. For more information about Emms setup levels see
@xref{Setup}.

@defun emms-playlist-mode-go
Switch to the current emms-playlist buffer and use emms-playlist-mode.
@end defun

If you wish to make this the default Emms playlist mode, add the
following to your @file{.emacs}.

@lisp
(setq emms-playlist-default-major-mode 'emms-playlist-mode)
@end lisp

The interactive playlist buffer shows the tracks in the current Emms
playlist in the order in which they will be played. The current track
will be highlighted.

When in the interactive playlist mode we can perform different actions
on the current playlist.

@table @kbd
@item a
@findex emms-playlist-mode-add-contents
Add files in the playlist at point to the current playlist buffer.
If we are in the current playlist, make a new playlist buffer and
set it as current.
@item b
@findex emms-playlist-set-playlist-buffer
Set the current playlist buffer.
@item n
@findex emms-next
Start playing the next track in the playlist.
@item p
@findex emms-next
Start playing the previous track in the playlist.
@item s
@findex emms-stop
Stop playing.
@item P
@findex emms-pause
Pause.
@item >
@findex emms-seek-forward
Seek ten seconds forward.
@item <
@findex emms-seek-backward
Seek ten seconds backward.
@item f
@findex emms-show
Describe the currently playing track in the minibuffer.
@item c
@findex emms-playlist-mode-center-current
Display the current track in the center of the screen.
@item RET
@findex emms-playlist-mode-play-current-track
Start playing the track under point. Note that this is also available
with @kbd{<mouse-2>}.
@item SPC
@findex scroll-up
Scroll up a near full page.
@item M-<
@findex emms-playlist-mode-first
Go to the first track in the playlist.
@item M->
@findex emms-playlist-mode-last
Go to the last track in the playlist.
@item r
@findex emms-random
Go to a randomly selected track in the playlist.
@item q
@findex bury-buffer
Put the interactive playlist buffer at the end of the list of all
buffers.
@item C-x C-s
@findex emms-playlist-save
Save the current playlist buffer to a file. By default, Emms will ask
you for confirmation before overwriting an existing playlist. You can
silently overwrite existing playlist by setting
@var{emms-source-playlist-ask-before-overwrite} to nil.
@item ?
@findex describe-mode
Describe the mode.
@end table

We can also edit the playlist using familiar GNU/Emacs commands:

@table @kbd
@item C-k
@findex emms-playlist-mode-kill-track
Remove the track under point from the playlist buffer. Also available
using the @kbd{d} key.
@item C-y
@findex emms-playlist-mode-yank
See the command @command{yank}
@item C-w
@findex emms-playlist-mode-kill
See the command @command{kill-region}
@item M-y
@findex emms-playlist-mode-yank-pop
See the command @command{yank-pop}.
@item C-j
@findex emms-playlist-mode-insert-newline
Insert a newline at point.
@end table

We can use the regular GNU/Emacs killing and yanking commands to move
and copy tracks in between playlist buffers. We can use the same
commands to insert arbitrary text into the playlist buffers together
with the playlist tracks. Text which is not a track is ignored by the
program and can therefore be used to include titles and annotations
within the playlist.

@node Markable Playlists
@chapter Markable Playlists

@cindex Markable Playlists

The Markable Playlists provided by the file @file{emms-mark.el} are an
alternative to the default interactive playlists, @xref{Interactive
Playlists}. They allow marking tracks with keybindings familiar to users
of dired.

To enable the Markable Playlists you have to add

@lisp
(require 'emms-mark)
@end lisp

to your @file{.emacs}. Then you can activate @command{emms-mark-mode} by
executing @command{M-x emms-mark-mode} in a playlist buffer. You can
return to the default interactive playlist mode with @command{M-x
emms-mark-mode-disable}.

If you wish to make this the default Emms playlist mode, add the
following to your @file{.emacs}.

@lisp
(setq emms-playlist-default-major-mode 'emms-mark-mode)
@end lisp

@table @kbd
@item m
@findex emms-mark-forward
Marks the current track and sets point one line forward. If a prefix
argument ARG is given, it will mark the next ARG tracks and set point
accordingly. A negative argument marks backward.
@item U
@findex emms-mark-unmark-all
Unmarks all tracks in the playlist.
@item t
@findex emms-mark-toggle
Toggles mark on the current track.
@item u
@findex emms-mark-unmark-forward
Unmarks same way as @command{emms-mark-forward} marks.
@item % m
@findex emms-mark-regexp
Marks all tracks in the playlist matching the given regular
expression. A prefix argument means to unmark them instead.
@end table

When tracks are marked you can operate on them:

@table @kbd
@item D
@findex emms-mark-delete-marked-tracks
Deletes the marked tracks from the playlist.
@item K
@findex  emms-mark-kill-marked-tracks
Deletes the marked tracks from the playlist and places them in the
kill-ring, so that you can @command{yank} in into another playlist.
@item W
@findex emms-mark-copy-marked-tracks
Adds the marked tracks to the kill-ring, so that you can @command{yank}
them into another playlist.
@end table

emms-mark is also intent to provide a way for user to select tracks
for other command to operate on them. Currently,
@file{emms-tag-editor.el} uses the emms-mark to edit the tags of
selected tracks. Two functions are useful for the elisp programmer to
handle marked tracks.

@defun emms-mark-do-with-marked-track
This function take a function to perform on all marked tracks. A
optional argument `move-flag' to tell the function to move forward
line after calling given function. If the given function didn't change
position, the second argument should set to non-nil.
@end defun

@defun emms-mark-mapcar-marked-track
This function is very similar to `emms-mark-do-with-marked-track'
except it collects result of given function (that's why named with
`mapcar').

@end menu



@node New Player
@section New Player

@cindex new player
@cindex defining new players

The file @file{emms-player-simple.el} defines some easy players to
start with, but it shouldn't be hard to provide a function for your
favourite player. We will start with an easy example that shows how
we can use the @command{play} command under Unix to play our WAV files.



@node Simple Player for `play'
@section Simple Player for `play'

@cindex simple player
@cindex primitive player
@cindex basic player

Play is a very easy command line player for various format. If you
want your emms to play WAV files just put the following lines in you
@file{.emacs}:

@lisp
(require 'emms-player-simple)
(define-emms-simple-player play '(file) "\\.wav$" "play")
@end lisp
@noindent

Huh! Wasn't that easy?

The macro function @command{define-emms-simple-player} takes a minimum
of three arguments. The first argument (@emph{play} in our example)
defines the name of the player. It's used to name the player
functions. The second is a regexp, that defines which files to play
with our player. @emph{\\.wav$} matches any filename ending with a dot
and the string wav. The last argument is the actual command line
command we use to play our files. You can also add the path but we
just assume that the command is in your path. All arguments you add to
these three are optional. They define the command line arguments you
want to add to your argument. If you want to hear the wav file of your
favourite artist in the most possible volume use the following line:

@lisp
(require 'emms-player-simple)

(define-emms-simple-player play
                           '(file)
                           "\\artist-*.wav$"
                           "play"
                           "--volume=100")
@end lisp
@noindent

Please notice that you have to add the arguments as strings!

The command line tool you use for @command{define-emms-simple-player}
has to take one song as argument and stop after playing that
particular song. For any other concept you will need to customise
emms a bit more...



@node More Complex Player
@section More Complex Player

@cindex complex player
@cindex advanced player

The most players you use will be simple players so you don't need to
read this chapter. But if you are curious how you can use (almost) every
player in emms read further...

In this chapter we will use mpg321 to construct a player that
actually can pause a track, restart it and show rest time. We won't
implement all of that, but after that chapter you will know how to
define it.

The command @command{define-emms-simple-player} is just a abstraction
layer for @command{define-emms-player}, which is a little bit more
complicated but much more powerful!

@lisp
(define-emms-player "emms-mpg321-remote"
  :start 'emms-mpg321-remote-start
  :stop 'emms-mpg321-remote-stop
  :playablep 'emms-mpg321-remote-playable-p)
@end lisp
@noindent

So, that is almost all! @command{define-emms-player} takes a minimum
of three arguments. The first is the name of the player. The rest are
methods with functions to call. Three methods are required: start,
stop and playable. Start says Emms how to start a track (sic!), stop
how to stop a player and playablep should return non-nil if the player
can play the track.

So we just need these three functions to get our mpg321-remote:

First we code the start function. We will check if there's a open
process and start one otherwise. Then we send a string to the process
with the filename and set a filter.

@lisp
(defun emms-mpg321-remote-start ()
  (unless (get-process ``mpg321-remote'')
    (setq emms-mpg321-remote-process
          (start-process "mpg321-remote-process"
                         "*mpg321*" "mpg321" "-R" "abc"))
  (process-send-string "mpg321-remote-process"
                       (concat "l " (emms-track-name track)))
  (set-process-filter emms-mpg321-remote-process 'emms-mpg321-remote-filter)))
@end lisp
@noindent

We need the filter, as mpg321-remote won't quit after playing the
track as the simple player do. We wait until the process sends the
output ``(at-sign)P 0'' (the signal of mpg321 that the song ended) to the
filter and call emms-mpg321-remote-stop.

@lisp
(defun emms-mpg321-remote-filter (process output)
  (when (string-match "(at-sign)P 0" output)
    (emms-mpg321-remote-stop)))
@end lisp
@noindent

@command{emms-mpg321-remote-stop} won't do anything interesting. It
just test if there are other files to play and close the process otherwise.

@lisp
(defun emms-mpg321-remote-stop ()
  (unless emms-playlist
    (process-send-string "mpg321-remote-process" "Q\n"))
@end lisp
@noindent

And to make that a playable example I also added
@command{emms-mpg321-remote-playablep}, which I really just steal
from @file{emms-player-simple.el}

@lisp
(defun emms-mpg321-remote-playablep (track)
       "Return non-nil when we can play this track."
       (and (eq 'file (emms-track-type track))
@end lisp
@noindent

Now we have a ready player and we could add commands like
@command{emms-mpg321-remote-pause} for example.

 "all-files" (emms-browser-filter-only-type 'file))
@end lisp

Show only tracks in one folder:

@lisp
(emms-browser-make-filter
 "80s" (emms-browser-filter-only-dir "~/Mp3s/80s"))
@end lisp

Show all tracks played in the last month:

@lisp
(emms-browser-make-filter
 "last-month" (emms-browser-filter-only-recent 30))
@end lisp

After executing the above commands, you can use M-x
emms-browser-show-all, emms-browser-show-80s, etc to toggle between
different collections. Alternatively you can use '<' and '>' to cycle
through the available filters.

The second argument to make-filter is a function which returns t if a
single track should be filtered. You can write your own filter
functions to check the type of a file, etc.

Show only tracks not played in the last year:

@lisp
(emms-browser-make-filter "not-played"
 (lambda (track)
  (not (funcall (emms-browser-filter-only-recent 365) track))))
@end lisp

Show all files that are not in the pending directory:

@lisp
(emms-browser-make-filter
 "all"
 (lambda (track)
   (or
    (funcall (emms-browser-filter-only-type 'file) track)
    (not (funcall
          (emms-browser-filter-only-dir "~/Media/pending") track)))))
@end lisp



@node Displaying Covers
@section Displaying Covers

The browser will attempt to display cover images if they're
available.

Customize @var{emms-browser-covers} to configure how EMMS should retrieve the
covers.

By default it looks for images @file{cover_small.jpg}, @file{cover_med.jpg},
etc. Note that you'll probably want to resize your existing covers to particular
sizes. Suggested sizes are 100x100 for small, and 200x200 for medium.

The above behaviour demands manual processing on behalf of the user.  Instead,
you might prefer to automate the process by setting @var{emms-browser-covers} to
'emms-browser-cache-thumbnail': covers matching 'emms-browser-thumbnail-filter'
will be automatically resized if necessary and cached to
@var{emms-browser-thumbnail-directory}.  The cache gets automatically updated
upon change in the source folder.

Customize @var{emms-browser-covers-file-extensions} to include or exclude
specific extensions.

'emms-browser-cache-thumbnail' might be everytime a cover is queried, so
to help with performance you can also set @var{emms-browser-covers} to
'emms-browser-cache-thumbnail-async'.  The latter is like the former
except that it caches queries: every subsequent query will be much
faster.  The drawback is that it won't see changes made to covers after
the first query.  To force-refresh the thumbnail cache, you can run
'emms-browser-clear-cache-hash'.

Also, Emacs by default will jump around a lot when scrolling a buffer
with images. In order to prevent that, you can set
@var{scroll-up-aggressively} and @var{scroll-down-aggressively} to the
number ``0.0''.

To show a 'no cover' image for albums which don't have a cover, add
the following code to your .emacs:

@lisp
(setq emms-browser-default-covers
  (list "/path/to/cover_small.jpg" nil nil)
@end lisp

The medium and large images can be set as well.

You can download an example @uref{http://repose.cx/cover_small.jpg,
`no cover' image}.



@node Changing Looks
@section Changing Looks

The Browser's look can be customised. You can change the way the tree
structure looks, the display format and display faces.

@subheading Changing Tree Structure

You can change the way the tree is displayed by modifying the function
@command{emms-browser-next-mapping-type}.

The following code displays artist->track instead of
artist->album->track when you switch to the 'singles' filter:

@lisp
(defadvice emms-browser-next-mapping-type
                                (after no-album (current-mapping))
  (when (eq ad-return-value 'info-album)
    (setq ad-return-value 'info-title)))
@end lisp

@lisp
(defun toggle-album-display ()
  (if (string= emms-browser-current-filter-name "singles")
      (ad-activate 'emms-browser-next-mapping-type)
    (ad-deactivate 'emms-browser-next-mapping-type)))

(add-hook 'emms-browser-filter-changed-hook 'toggle-album-display)
@end lisp

Furthermore, you can customize
@var{emms-browser-get-track-field-function} to choose which the metadata
fields used for the different tree nodes (@code{'info-artist},
@code{info-year}, etc.).  For instance, you can choose whether to
organize the tree by artist, album artist or performer.

@subheading Changing Display Format

Format strings govern the way items are displayed in the browser and
playlist. You can customize these if you wish.

@var{emms-browser-default-format} controls the format to use when no
other format has been explicitly defined. By default, only track and
albums deviate from the default.

To customise the format of a particular type, find the name of the
field you want to use (eg `info-artist', `info-title', etc), and
insert that into emms-browser-<type>-format or
emms-browser-playlist-<type>-format. For example, if you wanted to
remove track numbers from tracks in both the browser and playlist, you
could do:

@lisp
(defvar emms-browser-info-title-format "%i%n")
(defvar emms-browser-playlist-info-title-format
  emms-browser-info-title-format)
@end lisp

The format specifiers available include:

@itemize @w{}
@item
%i    indent relative to the current level
@item
%n    the value of the item - eg -info-artist might be ``pink floyd''
@item
%y    the album year
@item
%A    the album name
@item
%a    the artist name of the track
@item
%t    the title of the track
@item
%T    the track number
@item
%cS   a small album cover
@item
%cM   a medium album cover
@item
%cL   a big album cover
@end itemize

Note that if you use track-related items like %t, it will take the
data from the first track.

@subheading Changing Display Faces

The faces used to display the various fields are also customizable.
They are in the format emms-browser-<type>-face, where type is one of
"year/genre", "artist", "album" or "track". Note that faces lack the
initial "info-" part. For example, to change the artist face, type M-x
@command{customize-face} @command{emms-browser-artist-face}.

@cindex sort
@cindex track order

The `emms-playlist-sort' module, defined in the
@file{emms-playlist-sort.el} package provides functions for sorting
Emms playlists, as well as keyboard shortcuts for invoking the
functions in the playlist buffer. Most of the functions will sort in
reverse order if the command is preceded by a

@node Persistent Playlists
@chapter Persistent Playlists

The Emms module @file{emms-history.el} makes playlists persistent over
emacs sessions.  To make use of this feature put this into your
~/.emacs.

@lisp
(require 'emms-history)
@end lisp

When you kill emacs all playlists will be saved in the file given by the
variable:

@defopt emms-history-file
The file to save playlists in.  It defaults to
"~/.emacs.d/emms-history".
@end defopt

After you started up emacs again, you can restore all saved playlists
with this function.

@defun emms-history-load
Restore all playlists in `emms-history-file'.
@end defun

If that should be done automatically on each startup, put these lines
into your ~/.emacs.

@lisp
(require 'emms-history)
(emms-history-load)
@end lisp

Normally @code{emms-history} only restores playlists.  If you want it to
start playback afterwards, you can tweak this variable.

@defopt emms-history-start-playing
If non-nil emms starts playing the current track after
`emms-history-load' was invoked.  The default value is nil.
@end defopt


@c -------------------------------------------------------------------
@node Editing Tracks
@chapter Editing Tracks

@cindex track editor

Using @file{emms-tag-editor.el}, emms can set tag informations of tracks
and write them back to the file with the help of external programs, such
as `mid3v2' and `vorbiscomment'.

Use the keybinding @kbd{E} to edit the tags of track under point in the
playlist or all marked tracks (@pxref{Markable Playlists} for how to
mark tracks).  The track's tag informations are listed in a special
buffer `*Emms-TAGS*' in text format.  Field names are marked in bold
face and are not editable.  Any tag information is placed behind an
equal sign and is changeable.  A special field `name' is the track's file
name.  If any change is made in this field, the track's file will be
renamed to the new name.  When you finished editing the tag infos use
@kbd{C-c C-c} (which calls @code{emms-tag-editor-submit-and-exit}) to
submit the changes and close the `*Emms-TAGS*' buffer.

There are a few commands to perform changes on all tracks.

@defun emms-tag-editor-set-all tag value
Set TAG to VALUE in all tracks.

If transient-mark-mode is turned on, you can apply the command to a
selected region.

If `transient-mark-mode' is on and the mark is active, the changes will
only take effect on the tracks in the region.
@end defun

@defun emms-tag-editor-replace-in-tag tag from to
Query and replace text in selected TAG.

For example, if the info-title tag is selected, then only perform
replacement in title tags.

If `transient-mark-mode' is on and the mark is active, the changes will
only take effect on the tracks in the region.
@end defun

@defun emms-tag-editor-transpose-tag tag1 tag2
Transpose value of TAG1 and TAG2.

If `transient-mark-mode' is on and the mark is active, the changes will
only take effect on the tracks in the region.
@end defun

@defun emms-tag-editor-submit arg
Make modified tags take affect.

With prefix argument, bury the tag edit buffer.
@end defun

If you want to extend the tag editor to work with file formats other
than `mp3' and `ogg', have a look at these variables.

@defvr {Variable} emms-tag-editor-formats
This variable determine how to insert track fields to
`emms-tag-editor-edit-buffer'.  Emms tag info editable fields is usually
determined by the extension of track name.  The variable
`emms-tag-editor-tags' contains all tags that emms track may have.  A
single character is assigned to the tag to make the
`emms-tag-editor-formats' easier to generate.
@end defvr

@defvr {Variable} emms-tag-editor-tagfile-functions
To write tags to track file, an extern program should specified in this
variable.
@end defvr

@heading Renaming Files

The tag editor is also capable to rename the file of the track at point
or all files of the marked tracks according to the value this variable.

@defopt emms-tag-editor-rename-format
When `emms-tag-editor-rename' is invoked the track's file will be
renamed according this format specification.  The file extension will be
added automatically.

It uses the format specs defined in @code{emms-tag-editor-tags}.

The default value is "%a - %l - %n - %t", so that files are named

  <Artist> - <Album> - <Tracknumber> - <Title>.<extension>

after renaming.
@end defopt

To perform the renaming put point on the track you want to rename or
mark some tracks.  Then hit @kbd{R} which calls this function:

@defun emms-tag-editor-rename
Rename the file corresponding to track at point or all marked tracks
according to the value of @code{emms-tag-editor-rename-format}.
@end defun

@cindex display emms information

We can display information about the currently playing track on the
Emacs mode line using the package `emms-mode-line' which is provided
by the file @file{emms-mode-line.el}.

To activate this feature invoke:

@lisp
(require 'emms-mode-line)
(emms-mode-line 1)
@end lisp

It is also possible to display the amount of time a track has been
playing. This feature is defined in the `emms-playing-time' package
which is provided by the file @file{emms-playing-time.el}.

To use this feature invoke:

@lisp
(require 'emms-playing-time)
(emms-playing-time 1)
@end lisp

Note: `(emms-playing-time -1)' will disable emms-playing-time module
completely, and is not recommended. (since some other emms modules may
rely on it)

Instead, to toggle displaying playing time on mode line, one could call
`emms-playing-time-enable-display' and
`emms-playing-time-disable-display'."

@defun emms-playing-time-enable-display
Display playing time on mode line.

@cindex limiting
@cindex playlist

The package `emms-playlist-limit', provided by
@file{emms-playlist-limit.el}, allows creating a new
playlist derived from the playlist in the current
buffer. For instance, it is possible to create a new
playlist containing only a certain artist or genre from the

@node Music Player Daemon
@chapter Music Player Daemon

@cindex music player daemon
@cindex remote interface
@cindex mpd

Emms provides an interface to the @uref{http://www.musicpd.org/, Music
Player Daemon}(MusicPD) software. The package is called `emms-player-mpd' and
is provided by the file @file{emms-player-mpd.el}.

The advantages of using MusicPD as an Emms backend include the
following.

@itemize @bullet
@item minimal CPU usage
@item fast access of track information
@item optional crossfade
@end itemize

@subheading Setup

To load `emms-player-mpd' invoke:

@lisp
(require 'emms-player-mpd)
@end lisp

Set the variables @var{emms-player-mpd-server-name} and
@var{emms-player-mpd-server-port} to the location and port
(respectively) of your MusicPD server. For example:

@lisp
(setq emms-player-mpd-server-name "localhost")
(setq emms-player-mpd-server-port "6600")
@end lisp

If your MusicPD setup requires a password, you will to set
@var{emms-player-mpd-server-password} as follows.

@lisp
(setq emms-player-mpd-server-password "mypassword")
@end lisp

To get track information from MusicPD, invoke the following:

@lisp
(add-to-list 'emms-info-functions 'emms-info-mpd)
@end lisp

Adding `emms-player-mpd' to your Emms player list is accomplished by
invoking:

@lisp
(add-to-list 'emms-player-list 'emms-player-mpd)
@end lisp

Unless your MusicPD is configured to use absolute file names, you must
set the emms-player-mpd-music-directory variable to the value of
'music_directory' in your MusicPD configuration.  There are
additional options available as well, but the defaults should be
sufficient for most uses.

Once you've done the above, run the @kbd{M-x
emms-cache-set-from-mpd-all} command to fill the Emms cache with the
contents of your MusicPD database. The music in your MusicPD database
should then be accessible via the Emms browser.

You can set @var{emms-player-mpd-sync-playlist} to nil if your master
Emms playlist contains only stored playlists.

@subheading Commands provided

@defun emms-player-mpd-connect
Connect to MusicPD and retrieve its current playlist. Afterward, the
status of MusicPD will be tracked.
@end defun

@defun emms-player-mpd-disconnect
Terminate the MusicPD client process and disconnect from MusicPD.
@end defun

@defun emms-player-mpd-show &optional insertp
Describe the current Emms track in the minibuffer. If INSERTP is
non-nil, insert the description into the current buffer instead. This
function uses @var{emms-show-format} to format the current track. It
differs from @command{emms-show} in that it asks MusicPD for the
current track, rather than Emms.
@end defun

@subsubheading Updating the MusicPD database

@defun emms-player-mpd-update-directory dir
Cause the tracks in DIR to be updated in the MusicPD database.
@end defun

@defun emms-player-mpd-update-all
Cause all tracks in the MusicPD music directory to be updated in
the MusicPD database.
@end defun

@subsubheading emms-cache.el integration

@defun emms-cache-set-from-mpd-directory dir
Dump all MusicPD data from DIR into the Emms cache.
This is useful to do when you have recently acquired new music.
@end defun

@defun emms-cache-set-from-mpd-all
Dump all MusicPD data into the Emms cache.
This is useful to do once, just before using emms-browser.el, in
order to prime the cache.
@end defun

@subsubheading emms-volume.el integration

To activate this, add the following to your .emacs.

@lisp
(require 'emms-volume)
(setq emms-volume-change-function 'emms-volume-mpd-change)
@end lisp

@node Lyrics
@chapter Lyrics

@cindex lyrics

We can display the lyrics of a song in time with the music using the
`emms-lyrics' package provided by the file @file{emms-lyrics.el}.

The lyrics files should have the extention ``.lrc'', and can be placed
under either the same directory as the music files or
@var{emms-lyrics-dir}.

To add this feature we invoke:

@lisp
(require 'emms-lyrics)
(emms-lyrics 1)
@end lisp

There are a number of variables we can set to define the way that
`emms-lyrics' behaves, we can set these directly or by using the
Customize feature in Emacs.

@defvr {User Option} emms-lyrics-display-on-minibuffer
If non-nil, display lyrics on minibuffer.
@end defvr

@defvr {User Option} emms-lyrics-display-on-modeline
If non-nil, display lyrics on modeline.
@end defvr

@defvr {User Option} emms-lyrics-dir
Local lyrics repository.
@command{emms-lyrics-find-lyric} will look for lyrics in current
directory(i.e., same as the music file) and this directory.
@end defvr

@defvr {User Option} emms-lyrics-display-format
Format for displaying lyrics. "%s" will be replaced by the lyrics
string.
@end defvr

@defvr {User Option} emms-lyrics-coding-system
Coding system used in the output of lyrics.
@end defvr

@defvr {User Option} emms-lyrics-scroll-p
Non-nil value will enable lyrics scrolling.
@end defvr

@defvr {User Option} emms-lyrics-scroll-timer-interval
Interval between scroller timers. The shorter, the faster.
@end defvr

We can control `emms-lyrics' with the help of the following functions:

@defun emms-lyrics-start
Start displaying lyrics.
@end defun

@defun emms-lyrics-stop
Stop displaying lyrics.
@end defun

@defun emms-lyrics-toggle-display-on-minibuffer
Toggle display lyrics on minibufer.
@end defun

@defun emms-lyrics-toggle-display-on-modeline
Toggle display lyrics on mode line.
@end defun

@defun emms-lyrics-enable
Enable displaying Emms lyrics.
@end defun

@defun emms-lyrics-disable
Disable displaying Emms lyrics.
@end defun

@defun emms-lyrics-toggle
Toggle displaying Emms lyrics.
@end defun


@c -------------------------------------------------------------------
@node Volume
@chapter Volume

@cindex volume

We can use the `emms-volume' package, as provided by the
@file{emms-volume.el} file, to manipulate the volume.

@defopt emms-volume-change-amount
The amount to use when raising or lowering the volume using the
emms-volume interface.

This should be a positive integer.
@end defopt

@defun emms-volume-raise
Increase the volume.
@end defun

@defun emms-volume-lower
Decrease the volume.
@end defun

If you feel like binding those two functions to global keys --- don't do
it or you'll miss the convenience of `emms-volume-minor-mode'. Instead,
bind the following two commands to some keys that you like.

@defun emms-volume-mode-plus
Raise volume and enable or extend the `emms-volume-minor-mode' timeout.
@end defun

@defun emms-volume-mode-minus
Lower volume and enable or extend the `emms-volume-minor-mode' timeout.
@end defun

Example:

@lisp
(global-set-key (kbd "C-c +") 'emms-volume-mode-plus)
(global-set-key (kbd "C-c -") 'emms-volume-mode-minus)
@end lisp

Whenever you use one of these keys or call these functions with
@kbd{M-x}, Emms will be put into `emms-volume-minor-mode' for a short
period defined by `emms-volume-mode-timeout'.

@defopt emms-volume-mode-timeout
The timeout in amount of seconds used by `emms-volume-minor-mode'.
@end defopt

In this interval you can raise/lower the volume simply by pressing
@kbd{+} or @kbd{-}, which will also reset the timer to its initial
value. So instead of pressing @kbd{C-c +} six times to increase volume
by six steps of @code{emms-volume-change-amount}, you would simply type
@kbd{C-c + + + + + +}.

Emms can change volume with amixer, mpd, PulseAudio and mixerctl out
of the box, see @var{emms-volume-change-function}.

@node Streaming Audio
@chapter Streaming Audio

@cindex streaming audio
@cindex internet radio

Emms is a great way to play streaming audio and internet radio. It is
possible to add streaming playlists and URLs to any playlist, but Emms
also comes with a built-in, eclectic list of streaming audio
stations. @footnote{Emms has no affiliation of any kind with the
streaming audio stations included, nor is their inclusion an
endorsement of these stations. Instead, this is a collection of
stations submitted to the project over the years by people who enjoy
Emms. We hope you will enjoy them too, and invite you to send in your
suggestions to add to the list.}

The @file{emms-streams.el} package provides the command
@command{emms-streams}.

Invoking @command{emms-streams} will pull up an Emms playlist buffer
and populate it with the built-in list of streaming audio sources.

@node APE / FLAC Commands
@chapter APE / FLAC Commands

Often, a single APE or FLAC file contains a complete album.  We can still
play next or previous track in the album with the help of
@file{emms-cue.el} package, provided there is a corresponding cue sheet
file.  This package also defines @code{emms-info-cueinfo} for retrieving
the track information for APE / FLAC itself.

To load @file{emms-cue.el}:

@lisp
(require 'emms-cue)
(add-to-list 'emms-info-functions 'emms-info-cueinfo)
@end lisp

@defun emms-cue-next
Play next track from .cue file
@end defun
@defun emms-cue-previous

@end defun



@c -------------------------------------------------------------------
@node Bookmarks
@chapter Bookmarks

Emms can save a ``temporal bookmark'' in a media file via
emms-bookmarks. The file @file{emms-bookmarks.el} provides the package
emms-bookmarks.

While some media is playing, invoking @kbd{M-x emms-bookmarks-add}
will first pause the playback and then prompt for a name describing
the bookmark. Tracks can have multiple bookmarks associated with them.

To jump to the next and previous bookmarks in the current track invoke
@kbd{M-x emms-bookmarks-next} and @kbd{M-x emms-bookmarks-prev}

@chapter Managing Playlists

Emms can have multiple playlists, since a playlist is just another
buffer with a list of tracks. You can manage multiple playlists using
`emms-metaplaylist-mode', provided by the file
@file{emms-metaplaylist-mode}.

Start the playlist manager with @kbd{M-x
emms-metaplaylist-mode-go}. The playlist manager will list the
playlists and mark the current one. The following commands are
available:

@table @kbd

@item RET
@kindex RET
@findex emms-metaplaylist-mode-goto-current
Make the buffer at point the Emms playlist buffer and switch to it.

@item SPC
@kindex SPC
@findex emms-metaplaylist-mode-set-active
Make the buffer at point the Emms playlist buffer (but do not switch
to it).

@item n
@kindex n
@findex next-line
Move point to the next playlist.

@item p
@kindex p
@findex previous-line

@cindex GNU FM

@url{https://www.gnu.org/software/gnufm/, GNU FM} is free software for
running music community websites. It was created for the music
community site, @url{http://libre.fm/, Libre.fm}.

Emms can send track information, and stream music from GNU FM servers
using @file{emms-librefm-scrobbler.el} and
@file{emms-librefm-stream.el}, respectively.

Emms is configured by default to use @url{http://libre.fm/, Libre.fm},
but can work with any GNU FM server by configuring the variable
@var{emms-librefm-scrobbler-handshake-url} to the URL of the GNU FM
server.

The recommended way of providing your credentials to the GNU FM server
is by using an authinfo file.  Add authentication to your auth-info
file, typically @file{~/.authinfo.gpg}, as:
@smallexample
machine libre.fm login USERNAME password PASSWORD
@end smallexample
If you are using some other server than libre.fm, change
``@samp{libre.fm}'' to match
@var{emms-librefm-scrobbler-handshake-url}.

Alternatively, you can save the password in plaintext in your init-file
by setting these variables:

@lisp
(setq emms-librefm-scrobbler-username "USERNAME"
      emms-librefm-scrobbler-password "PASSWORD")
@end lisp

@menu
* Uploading Track Information:: How to submit listened track information.
* GNU FM Streaming:: Streaming music from a GNU FM server.
@end menu



@node Uploading Track Information
@section Uploading Track Information

GNU FM servers, such as Libre.fm can optionally store a user's
listening habits using information sent to the website's server from
the Emms. By utilizing the records of users' listening habits, the
website aims to be able to recommend music to users by analyzing their
musical taste.

Load the feature into Emms with:

@lisp
(require 'emms-librefm-scrobbler)
@end lisp

This feature can also be enabled via @xref{Setup}, in the `emms-all'
setup level.

Enable uploading the details of the tracks Emms plays to the GNU FM
server with @kbd{emms-librefm-scrobbler-enable}. The track's details
will be uploaded to the server when the track's playback ends. You can
disable this behavior with @kbd{emms-librefm-scrobbler-disable}.




@node GNU FM Streaming
@section GNU FM Streaming

If the GNU FM server provides a streaming music service you can take
advantage of it by loading:

@lisp
(require 'emms-librefm-stream)
@end lisp

This feature can also be enabled via @xref{Setup}, in the `emms-all'
setup level.

Then invoke @kbd{emms-librefm-stream} and enter the URL of the station
you wish to listen to, for example ``librefm://globaltags/Classical''.
