This is an explanation of how to make a release for Emms. Emms is
developed at Savannah (https://savannah.gnu.org/projects/emms/) and
distributed via Emacs ELPA (https://elpa.gnu.org/).

* Check for clean compilation.

* Increase the version number in emms.el (variable, elpa header)

* Update NEWS

* Update the manual

* Update website (cvs commit -m "update website" index.html)

* Tag release in VCS, for example `git tag -a 4.2 -m "4.2"'

* Push tag to VCS, for example `git push --tags origin "4.2"'

* Push version updates to VCS

* If automatic syncronization is enabled then we are done. Otherwise:

    * Push to GNU ELPA:

          - merge master into the Savannah "elpa" branch and push to Savannah

          - from the "elpa" branch in Savannah push to elpa.git: "git push elpa elpa:externals/emms"

* Send announcement email to the emms mailing list
